# Learn In Public
On the off-chance that anyone else is reading this. Hi. I'm Josh. As a passionate autodidact I love to learn and I take a lot of notes about a lot of things under the sun.
My habit has led me to accumulate many 1000s of markdown notes. While you won't find all of them here, you will however find a curated subset that I'm comfortable enough to make available on the internet.
The goal behind all this is to start [Learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). 


### Publishing My Notes
For publishing my notes I use Quartz. Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
These notes are hosted on Github Pages (for now)
