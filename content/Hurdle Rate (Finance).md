### General
- A hurdle rate is the lowest rate of return a project or investment must achieve before a manager or investor deems it acceptable. 
- It's important when companies or investors make important decisions like pursuing a specific project. Riskier projects generally have higher hurdle rates than those with less risk.
- The term is also often used in [[Private Equity (PE) (Finance)]] investing and [[Hedge Fund (Finance)]] management. For example, in a private equity investment fund, the [[General Partner (GP)]] can only charge [[Performance Fee (Finance)]] (known as carried interest) if the [[Limited Partner (LP)]]'s rate of return crosses the prearranged [[Hurdle Rate (Finance)]].
