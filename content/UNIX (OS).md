### General
- Developed in 1970s at [[Bell Labs (Research Company)]]
- Developed by [[Ken Thompson (Programmer)]] and [[Dennis Ritchie (Programmer)]]
- This note is meant to capture things specific to the Unix OS but considering that I’ve more likely to be taking notes about Unix-like systems it will also serve as a note on Unix-like OSs. Unless I’m ever studying the UNIX OS in particular these two will remain in the same note

### Unix OS Family
- The UNIX OS family has families within itself
	- [[BSD Distributions (Operating System Group)]]
	- [[Linux (OS Family)]]
	- [[Solaris (Operating System)]]
	- Etc
