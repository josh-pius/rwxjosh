### General
- Treating trading partners equally
- A requirement that countries providing a trade concession to one trading partner extend the same treatment to others
- Has been used in trade treaties for 100s of years and it's principle of equal treatment unpin the [[World Trade Organization (WTO)]]

### United States Law
- In U.S. trade legislation, most-favored-nation treatment is now described as "permanent normal trade relations" to avoid the implication it confers preferential status.
- US denies MFN only to [[Cuba (Country)]] and [[North Korea (Country)]]


### Term Co-opted
- I don't have a source for this so this is just my theory
- The term has been co-opted and used in partnership agreements for example in [[Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) (Corporate Law)]] to state that no partner gets preferential terms for themselves
