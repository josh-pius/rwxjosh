### General
- Two events A and B are independent if
	- $P(AB)=P(A)P(B)$
 - Independence is symbolically represented as (displayed via [[LaTeX]])
 $$
 \newcommand{\indep}{\perp \!\!\! \perp}
 A \indep B
 $$
 - Independence is sometimes assumed, sometimes derived
 - Disjoint events with positive probability are not independent
 - If A and B are independent events them [[Conditional Probability (Probability)|Conditional Probability]] $P(A | B)=P(A)$
 - Dependence also has symbol which I'm not sure if Latex has it looks like a spring

### Independent Random Variables
[[Random Variable (Probability)]]
- Two random variables are independent if for every A and B
- $P(X \in A, Y \in B)=P(X \in A)P(Y \in B)$
- To validate independency through above equation would in most cases be tedious as we'd have to check all subsets of A and B, instead the following result using [[Probability Density Function (PDF) (Probability)]] helps
	- X and Y are independent if $f_{X,Y}=f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ for all values of x and y
