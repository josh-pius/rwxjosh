### General
-  [[MyBatis (Java Library)]] seems to parse each mapper query and created various [[SqlNode (MyBatis)]]'s out of it
- Such as 
	- [[StaticTextSqlNode (MyBatis)]] - The simplest node with only text
	- [[IfSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[MixedSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[ChooseSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[ForEachSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[SetSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[TextSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[TrimSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[VarDecSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
	- [[WhereSqlNode (MyBatis)]]
- Each of these have an `apply()`  function
	- Each also internally have a bunch of other types of nodes
	- `apply()` is called recursively until [[StaticTextSqlNode (MyBatis)]] is reached at which point the text is appended to the final SQL
