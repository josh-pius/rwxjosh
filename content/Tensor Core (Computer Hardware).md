### General
- Tensor Cores are specialized hardware units found in [[NVIDIA (Company)]] GPUs, designed to accelerate [[Matrix (Mathematics)|Matrix]] operations, particularly for [[Deep Learning (Machine Learning)]] and [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] tasks. 
- Introduced with the NVIDIA Volta architecture, Tensor Cores are optimized for performing mixed-precision floating-point calculations (FP16/FP32) used in the training and inference of neural networks.
