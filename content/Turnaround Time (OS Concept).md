- $T_{turnaround} = T_{completion} - T_{arrival}$
- The time it takes for a job to complete. The average turnaround time is a [[Central Processing Unit (CPU)|CPU (Computer)]] performance metric
- [[Shortest Job First (SJF) (OS Concept)]] and [[Shortest Time to Completion First (STCF) (OS Concept)]] optimizer for this metric. 
- [[Response Time (OS Concept)]] and [[Turnaround Time (OS Concept)]] are trade-offs
