I've listened to the book the past few weeks during walks and on the journey back home form work. There's a lot I've learnt
1. Deep Work: Long focus uninterrupted stretches of time used to create value
2. Benefit of Deep Work: Hard to replicate and rewarded well in our knowledge based economy
3. How to work deeply
	1. Cut out shallow low value work
	2. Cut out distractions
	3. Focus on the most high value tasks don't do too many things at the same time
	4. Create a pattern so it's easy to get into a state of deep work
	5. Build concentration and ability to focus by following suggestions in the book like memorizing a deco of cards using the loci method
4. I've reflected on what I've read and made changes to my daily schedule to cut out the clutter and take only tasks I see having high value form by short term plan
