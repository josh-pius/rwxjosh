### General
- Describes the process of taking a relatively weak or short key (or password) and "stretching" it to make it longer and stronger
- The "stretching" process involves using computational techniques to enhance the security of the original key or password, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks, even if the original key is relatively weak or short.
- One way of key stretching is to use a [[Salt (Cryptography)]]
- Another way is to hash repeatedly, many 1000s or millions of times, using an algorithm like [[bcrypt (Hashing Algorithm)]]
