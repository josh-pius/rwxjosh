### General
- By [[Wesley J Chun (Author)]]
- The first book I used to teach myself [[Python (Programming Language)]]
- I worked through most of it before I joined [[Fidelity (Company)]]
	- While it didn't help me much at work it gave me an edge when I started [[Competitive Programming]] as I already had all the syntax nailed down
	- It also gave me the confidence to learn from [[Textbook (Book Type)|textbooks]] directly
