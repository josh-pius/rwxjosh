### General
- A numerical optimization technique widely used in [[Linear Algebra (Mathematics)]]
- It is a decomposition of a [[Hermitian Matrix (Linear Algebra)|hermitian]] [[Positive Definite Matrix (Linear Algebra)|positive definite]] matrix into the produce of a [[Lower Triangular Matrix (L)(Linear Algebra)]] and it's [[Conjugate Transpose (Linear Algebra)]]
- Efficient for numerical solutions. eg [[Monte Carlo Method (Data Science)|monte carlo]] simulations
- When it is applicable it is roughly twice as efficient as the [[LU Decomposition (Linear Algebra)]] for solving a system of linear equations
- $A=LL^{*}$
