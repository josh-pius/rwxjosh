### General
- [[Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) (Book)]] mentions this in passing
- Bus snooping is used to invalidate or update a copy on a [[CPU Cache (Computer Hardware)]] when an issue with [[Cache Coherence (Software)]] is detected
- Wikipedia: Bus snooping or bus sniffing is a scheme by which a coherency controller (snooper) in a cache (a snoopy cache) monitors or snoops the bus transactions, and its goal is to maintain a cache coherency in distributed shared memory systems. This scheme was introduced by Ravishankar and Goodman in 1983, under the name "write-once" cache coherency. A cache containing a coherency controller (snooper) is called a snoopy cache.
