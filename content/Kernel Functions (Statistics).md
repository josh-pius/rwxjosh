### General
- It is a mathematical fact (Dual Space Optimization Theory) that for linear models in order to find the best fit model, learning algorithms only require the pairwise dot product of the observations, rather than individual points.
- There are many [[Kernel Functions (Statistics)]] available Polynomial Kernel, RBF Kernel

### Kernel Trick
See [[Kernel Trick (Statisitics)]]

### Polynomial Kernel
![[Polynomial Kernel (Statistics)]]

### Radial Kernel
- Aka Radial Basis Function Kernel
- Finds support vector classifiers in infinite dimensions
- Behaves like a weighted nearest neighbor mo dle
