### General
- In probability theory, moments are mathematical quantities that describe the characteristics and shape of probability distributions.
- They can also help quantify properties like dispersion and central tendency, and provide insights into the behavior of [[Random Variable (Probability)|random variables]]
- The $k^{th}$ **moment** of $X$ is defined to be $E(X^k)$ where E is [[Expected Value (Probability)|Expectation (Probability)]]
