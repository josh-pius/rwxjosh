### Possessive Nouns function as Adjective
- Sam's car is red
	- Here `Sam's` is an adjective
		- Even though Sam occurring by itself would be a [[Noun (English)]]
	- `is` is the linking verb
	- `red` is the adjective complement

### Compound Modifier
- When using a [[Compound Words (English)|open compound word]] as a single [[Adjective (English)]] you need to add hyphen to avoid ambiguity
- Example: "Ice cream" is an open compound but gets hyphenated here "The ice-cream shop"
- This is done to avoid ambiguity
- Exceptions: The one exception to this rule is if one of the words is an [[Adverb (English)]];
	- Correct: A beautifully crafted table -> No hyphen between beautifully and crafted
