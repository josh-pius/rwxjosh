### General
- Inverse operation of [[Differentiation (Calculus)]]

### Formula
1. Integral of a power function $\int x^ndx=\dfrac{u^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$


### Interpretation 
Source: https://youtu.be/MwVBzE7Z5gw?si=XgbT5uuWRZ7TH-r7 by [[Math the World (Youtuber)]]
- There are three popular ways to interpret integrals
1. Sum of area under a curve
2. Taking the anti-derivative
3. Adding up tiny parts

- Studies have found that most students hold onto (1) and (2) whereas the most useful view that help people use it in real life is (3) 

### Substitution Method
> [!Formula] 
>$\int{{f\left( {g\left( x \right)} \right)\,g'\left( x \right)\,dx}} = \int{{f\left( u \right)\,du}},\hspace{0.25in}{\mbox{where, }}u = g\left( x \right)$


- Example: $\int e^{-x}dx$
	- Substitute $u=-x$
	- $du=-dx$
	- $\implies -\int e^udu = -e^u + C=-e^{-x} +C$
