### General
- Numbers that fool [[Fermat's Primality Test (Mathematics)]]
- ere are 255 Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000
- The first few Carmichael numbers are: **561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, 6601, 8911, 10585, 15841, 29341**. These are even more rare than [[Prime Numbers (Mathematics)]]! Note: There are infinitely many Carmichael numbers.
- In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at random, the chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less than the chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error in carrying out a “correct” algorithm. 
	- Considering an algorithm to be inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the difference between mathematics and engineering
