### General
- Widely used measure in financial engineering
$SR=\dfrac{\text{Portfolio Returns}}{\text{Portfolio Volatility}}=\dfrac{w^T\mu}{\sqrt{w^T\Sigma w}}$

- [[Prof Daniel Palomar (Youtuber)]] in this video points out how this value is almost analogous to the [[Signal To Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) (Telecommunication Engineering)]]
