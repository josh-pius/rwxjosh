### Computer Science's Biggest Mystery

- Really good exposition on P vs NP
- Can problems whose solutions can be verified in [[Polynomial (Mathematics)]] time be solved in polynomial time
- Example
	- Checking if a solution to a 2-coloring or 3-coloring graph problem is easy and can be done in polynomial time
	- For 2-colorability you have algorithms that give you a solution in polynomial time as well, but no such solutions have been found for 3-coloring
	- Same with [[Sudoku (Game)]], you can verify a solution quickly, but finding a solution is hard
	- The P vs NP asks if whether being able to verify a problem in polynomial time allows us to also solve it in polynomial time
		- If sets P = NP, It might be that a algo has to exists for problems like 3-coloring and sudoku that can solve it as trivailly as we can verify the solution
- [[NP Complete (Computer Science)]] is a subset of the NP problems, [[Stephen Cook (Computer Scientist)]] showed that a polynomial type solution of an NP-complete problem would let you manufacture a polynomial time algorithm for any other NP problem
- Over the years [[Stephen Cook (Computer Scientist)]] and [[Leonid Levin (Computer Scientist)]]  discovered the [[Boolean Satisfiability (Computer Science)]] problem which is NP-complete
- Since then several [[NP Complete (Computer Science)]] problems have been found (1000s now)
	- 0-1 Integer programming
	- Set packing
	- Vertex cover
	- Set covering
	- Feedback node set
	- Feedback arc set
	- Directed Hamilton circuit
	- Undirected Hamilton cycle
	- 3-SAT
	- Graph coloring
	- Clique cover
	- Exact cover
	- Hitting set
	- Steiner tree
	- 3-dimensional matching
	- Knapsack
	- Job sequencing
	- Partition
	- Max cut
	- ...
- The process for converting the solution of an NP-complete problem to the solution for another problem is called "reduction"
- We still haven't found any solutions for NP-complete problems
- P vs NP is a question about the nature of thought itself
	- Is discovery fundamentally harder than recognition?
	- If it is true a mathematician could be replaced by a machine, every proof could be found by a sufficiently clever algorithm
