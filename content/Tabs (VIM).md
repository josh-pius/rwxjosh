### General
- A tab page holds one or more windows, i.e. could have vertical and horizontal splits
- Tabs help you to have many of these open at a time and switch between them
- A noobie mistake many developers make is to use tabs for everything but that wasn't what Tabs were built for in [[VIM (Editor)]]
	- VIMs concept of tabs is different
	- Tabs are meant to separate window collections
