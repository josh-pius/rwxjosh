- The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician [[John Conway (Mathematician)]].
- This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970.
- It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply.
