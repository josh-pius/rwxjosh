### Dark Side of Microfinance (Video)

- The idea was that these poor people don't have access to capital and giving them small loans would uplift them
- However the loans were used as means to take away people's property put them in jail etc.
- I recall a video where either [[Milton Friedman (Economist)]] or [[Thomas Sowell]] made the case that the free market with every incentive to maximize profits did not provide loans to these people because these companies with well-funded research dept. did not think these people would not be able to pay back these loans
	- So it's no surprise when the govt gives  loans with much less discretion that the rates of default go up
