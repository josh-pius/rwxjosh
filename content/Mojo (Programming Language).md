### General
- [[Chris Lattner (Computer Scientist)]] Does a good job explaining [[Mojo (Programming Language)]] here
	- They were working on beating Intel's performance by creating their own compiler
	- Once they did beat it they needed to be able to attach a syntax for it
	- They went looking for syntax to use for the powerful thing they already had and settled on Python
- So Mojo was not an attempt at another language but an interesting solution that was looking for a language to be able to use it
