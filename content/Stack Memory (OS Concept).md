### General
- Allocations and deallocations are managed implicitly by the compiler. For this reason it is often called automatic memory


### Example
```c
void func() {
	int x;
}
```
- The [[Compiler (Computer Science)]] makes space on the stack when it goes into the function and deallocates memory when you return from the function
