### General
- Columns of $A$ are "independent" if no column is a combination of the other columns
- For a [[Square Matrix (Linear Algebra)]] columns are independent if and only if rows are independent
- The mathematical definition of [[Linear Independence (Linear Algebra)]] states that n vectors $v_1,v_2,v_3,...,v_n$ are independent if the only solution to  the below equation is $c_1=c_2=...=c_n=0$

$$
