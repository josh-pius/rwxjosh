### General
- I have a copy in [[Various Books (Personal Github Repo)]]
- Focuses on [[Quantitative Analysis (Finance)]] and mostly on equity securities
### Purpose of the Book
- See [[Signal Processing (Field of Study)]]
 >The foundations of financial engineering lie on the statistical analysis of numerical time series and the modeling of the behavior of the financial markets in order to perform predictions and systematically optimize investment strategies. The purpose of this monograph is to explore such connections and to capitalize on the existing mathematical tools developed in wireless communications and signal processing to solve real-life problems arising in the financial markets in an unprecedented way
> Thus, this monograph is about investment in financial assets treated
 as a signal processing and optimization problem.

- Took a lot of notes from this book last week, put a pause on it afterward to focus on other things
