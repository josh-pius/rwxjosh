### General
- Named after Rudolph E. Kalman
- One of the most well-known and often used tools for stochastic estimation form noisy sensor measurements
- It is essentially a set of equations that implement a predictor-corrector type  [[Estimator (Statistics)]] that is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the estimated error covariance when some presumed conditions are met

	- Gave an actual code example of how a moving persons position could be tracked by getting observations from multiple cell towers around them
