### Applications
- Going through examples in [[Baeldung (Site)]] I think the timeout rule might be useful for [[Integration Testing (Software Testing)]]
- Another useful application might be to log out the test name

### Metadata
- Was hoping to use this to avoid code duplication in my unit tests
- However as a read the docs I got the impression that this might not suit my need, need to look into this more at a late date
