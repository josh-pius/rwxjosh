### General
- Boltzmann Machines are one of the earliest generative AI models, introduced in the 1980s.
- Boltzmann Machines are used for [[Unsupervised Learning (Machine Learning)]], which means they can learn from data without being told what to look for.
- They can be used for generating new data that is similar to the data they were trained on, also known as generative AI.
- A Boltzmann Machine is a type of [[Neural Networks (Machine Learning)]] that tries to learn patterns by mimicking how energy works in physics.
- Each neuron can be on or off, the machine is made up of many of these neurons connected to each other.
- It is an energy based model


### Restricted Boltzmann Machine
- A Restricted Boltzmann Machine is a special case where the visible and hidden neurons are not connected within the same layer. This makes it faster to train and understand.
- A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is trained using a process called [[Contrastive Divergence (Machine Learning)]]
