### General
- A set of points in a [[Vector Space (Linear Algebra)]] (often $\mathbb{R}^n$ - aka [[Real Vector Space (Linear Algebra)]]) with the property that for any two points in the entire set, the entire [[line segment (Mathematics)|line segment]] connection them is also in the set
- More technically a set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is convex if 
$$
\forall x,y \in C, \forall \lambda \in [0,1], \lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in C
$$
- The term $\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y$ represents all points on a straight line between x and y
- In other words a set is complex if it contains all [[Convex Combination (Mathematics)|convex combinations]] of it's points
