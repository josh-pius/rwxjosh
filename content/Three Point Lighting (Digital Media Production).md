### General
- Good video to understand how three point lighting works (found the link on the reddit post discussing this topic)
- https://youtu.be/pBt8qdO03-k?si=fXuYR4EdRAKhSSRj

- The three point lighting system consists of
	- Key Light: The most powerful light at at 25-45 degrees angle from the person
		- Highlights the person
	- Fill Light: At around the same angle with the person but the other direction
		- Removes any shadow due to the key light
		- Much less powerful than the key light
	- Back light: A light shining at the back of the person to give a sort of “halo” effect distinguishing the person from the background
