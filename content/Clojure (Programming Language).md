### General

### Robert C. Martin on Clojure
[[Robert C. Martin]] considers [[Clojure (Programming Language)]] his favorite programming language: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/08/22/WhyClojure.html

### Sample Program
- Sample code to return squares of first 25 numbers
```
 (take 25 (map #(* % %) (range)))
```

### Installing Clojure on Windows
- I installed to documents folder since installing to other folders failed due to permission issues
- You need to first get [[Windows PowerShell#Get Execute Rights]] (revert once done)
- Once you run the command on this page https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows and install is done run
- `powershell -command clj` will open up the clojure shell

### 4ever-Clojure
https://4clojure.oxal.org/
- A useful site where you can practice [[Clojure (Programming Language)]] problems
- Pretty decent way to learn clojure syntax, I was able to solve a bunch of them with no prior knowledge of clojure at all
