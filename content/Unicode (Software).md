### Code Point

- Code points are the numbers assigned by the Unicode Consortium to every character in every writing system. Code points are represented as U+ followed by four numbers and/or letters.
- Unicode provides a unique number (a code point) for every character of the major writing systems of the world
- Characters are units of information that roughly correspond to a unit of text in the written form of a natural language. Unicode defines how characters are interpreted, not how they are rendered.
- Unicode contains 1,114,112 code points; currently, characters are assigned to more than 96,000 of them.

There are three main Unicode character encoding schemes in use: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format. The numbers that follow UTF indicate the size, in bits, of units used for encoding.
