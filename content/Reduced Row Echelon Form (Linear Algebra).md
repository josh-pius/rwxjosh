### General
- A matrix is in reduced row-echelon form if it satisfies the following: In each row, the left-most nonzero entry is 1 and the column that contains this 1 has all other entries equal to 0. This 1 is called a leading 1.
- [[Matlab (Software)]] can convert a matrix into row echelon form using `rref(A)`
