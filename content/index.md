Hi, I'm Josh, a senior software engineer working in FinTech and this site is dedicated to learning in public by creating [learning exhaust](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

As an autodidact that loves to take notes, I've created almost >8000 notes spanning various topics. Keeping with the idea of maintaining atomic notes, each of my notes tends to be about a single concept/idea. 
Each note grows organically, some of them are just empty placeholders for a concept I want to refer to in other notes, others are much longer with a lot more information.
