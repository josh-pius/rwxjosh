Hi, I'm Josh, a software engineer working in FinTech, and this site is dedicated to learning in public.(see https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

As an autodidact that loves to take notes, I've created almost >9000 notes across various topics such as technology, computer science, finance, mathematics etc.

Keeping with the idea of maintaining atomic notes, each of my notes tends to be about a single concept/idea. 

Each note grows organically, some of them are just empty placeholders for a concept I want to refer to in other notes, others are much more fleshed out with a lot of information.

You will not find all my notes here, I publish only a subset of my notes based on what I feel comfortable sharing.
