Hi, I'm Josh, I'm a software engineer working in FinTech and this site is dedicated to learning in public by creating [learning exhaust](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
This site is primarily for myself, and provides me a place I can share the things I learn and what I'm working on at the moment.
