### General
- A broad concept in [[Operating System (OS)]] that lets the program use hardware directly but allows the OS to step in occasionally to ensure the right things happens: in other words **efficieny** and **control**
- For the [[Central Processing Unit (CPU)|CPU (Computer)]] this means timeslicing and scheduling
- For [[Memory (Computer)]] , we do the same things with [[Address Translation (OS Concept)]]
	- [[Base and Bound (OS Concept)]], TLB, Page-table support etc. all expand on this approach
	- I'm still learning about this and don't know all the notes to create
