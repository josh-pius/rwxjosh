### General
- The first part of the [[Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) (Book)]] book addresses CPU scheduling

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- Some are theoretical and not actually used
[[Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) (OS Concept)]]
[[Lottery Scheduling (OS Concept)]]
[[Stride Scheduling (OS Concept)]]
[[Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) (OS Concept)]]



### Multiprocessor Scheduling
[[Multiprocessor Scheduling (OS Concept)]]


### Linux Multiprocess Schedulers
- In the [[Linux (OS Family)]] community no common solution as emerged for schedulers. Over time there different schedulers arose
1. [[O(1) Scheduler (OS Concept)]]
2. [[Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) (OS Concept)]]
3. [[Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS) (OS Concept)]]

- [[O(1) Scheduler (OS Concept)]] and [[Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) (OS Concept)]] use multiple queues
- [[Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS) (OS Concept)]] uses a single queue
