- A scientist named Galton asked a large group of people to guess the weight of an ox
- Most guessed wrong. However the median value was eerily accurate to 1% of the actual weight
- This has been replicated by others experiments as well
- It only works if individuals guess privately
- If they work together the accuracy decreases as they try to reach a consensus
