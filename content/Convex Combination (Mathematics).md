### General
- A convex combination of points (or vectors) is a linear combination where all the coefficients are non-negative and sum to one. 
- In simpler terms, it's a way to create a new point that lies within or on the boundary of a shape formed by the original points. 
- See [[Convex Set (Mathematics)]]
