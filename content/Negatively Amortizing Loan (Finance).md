- Head [[Plain Bagel (Youtuber)]] mention this
- Sounds like a horrible situation that can take place if you have a fixed payment loan. 
- The interest rate goes so high up that the fixed payment no longer enough to cover the principle, and even worse it covers only a part of the interest, this leads to the total amount owed increasing overtime even though you're making payments
	- The interest rate at which this happens is called Trigger rate (?)

### Definition
- A negatively amortizing loan, sometimes called a negative amortization loan or negative amortized loan, is one with a payment structure that allows for a scheduled payment to be made by the borrower that is less than the interest charged on the loan. When that happens, [deferred interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredinterest.asp) is created.
- The amount of deferred interest created is added to the principal balance of the loan, leading to a situation where the principal owed increases over time instead of decreases.
