### General
- Instant history bias, also known as "backfill bias," is a phenomenon whereby inconsistent reporting practices can unduly inflate the apparent performance of a [[Hedge Fund (Finance)]].
- This inaccuracy stems from the fact that hedge fund managers can elect whether and when to report their results to the public. Because of this, managers often delay reporting their performance until they generate a track record of positive results. In doing so, they effectively hide the years in which they performed poorly.
- Instant history is a closely related concept to survivorship bias, which further undermines the accuracy of hedge fund performance statistics.
