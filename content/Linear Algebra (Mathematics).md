### Visualizing n Linear Equations in n Unknowns
1. Row Picture: Think Intersection of planes
	1. This analogy is fine in 2-3 dimensions but becomes hard to visualize in higher dimensions
2. Column picture: Combination of columns
	1. This is the more useful view according to [[Gilbert Strang (Mathematician)]]
$$
  x \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} \\ a_{21} \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} a_{12} \\ a_{22} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix} 

$$
### Solving n Equations in n Unknowns
1. Using [[Gaussian Elimination (Linear Algebra)]]
	1. We pick one equation multiple it to scale it to match coefficient of the variable in the second equation and back-substitute it
2. Using [[Determinant (Linear Algebra)]]
	1. Less efficient than elimination as the dimension increases
