### General
Source: [[All of Statistics (Book)]]
- Let $X=(X_1,...,X_n)$ where $X_1,...,X_n$ are [[Random Variable (Probability)|random variables]]
- We would then call $X$ a Random vector
- The [[Probability Density Function (PDF) (Probability)]] would be $f(x_1,...,x_n)$
- If all random variables were independent then
	- $P(X_1 \in A_1,..., X_n \in A_n)=\Pi_{i=1}^nP(X_i \in A_i)$
