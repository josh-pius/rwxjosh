### General
- A Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) filter bank is a system that decomposes a signal into its frequency components using a bank of cosine functions, similar to how a [[Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) (Signal Processing)]]  filter bank uses sine and cosine functions. 
- The key difference is that DCT uses only real numbers, unlike DFT which involves complex numbers. 
- DCT filter banks are often used in image and audio compression because the DCT effectively concentrates the energy of a signal into a few low-frequency components
