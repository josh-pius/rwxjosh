### General
- Headroom is the safe space between your average signal level and the [[Clipping (Sound Engineering)]] point.
- In digital systems, headroom is the number of decibels below 0 [[Decibels Relative to Full Scale (dBFS) (Sound Engineering)|dBFS]] you leave to avoid clipping.
- In analog systems, headroom allows temporary peaks to go over nominal levels without distortion.
- Typical headroom values:
	- -6 [[Decibels Relative to Full Scale (dBFS) (Sound Engineering)]] is often used as a safety buffer during tracking/recording.
	- In mixing/mastering, headroom is also left for post-processing or mastering engineers.
- If you're amplifying audio try to keep some headroom to avoid [[Clipping (Sound Engineering)]]
