### General
- A spinoff is formed when a company creates a new independent company by selling or distributing new shares of it's existing business.
- It is a type of [[Divestiture (Finance)]]
- A company creates a spinoff expecting that it will be worth more as an independent entity. 
- A spinoff is also known as a [spinout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spin-out.asp) or starburst.

### Why Spinoff
- Conglomerates, i.e.  companies invested in  a wide array of sectors were popular with investors in the past
	- Probably due to the diversification of the company which brings with it the expectation that it can better weather the ups and downs of the business cycle
- However it turned out conglomerates actually reduced shareholder value creating what's called a [[Conglomerate Discount (Finance)]]
- Due to this many conglomerates were dismantled and spunoff into more nimble companies that can be more effectively managed
- Investors who want diversification can invest in multiple companies
