### General
- A sophisticated name for the simple technique you learn in school where if you want you convert from say Km/h to m/s you just setup the multiplication such that the old units are cancelled and replaced with the new units 


### OSTEP Mention
- [[Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) (Book)]] authors had this to say about this technique
> Remember in Chemistry class, how you solved virtually every problem by simply setting up the units such that they canceled out, and somehow the answers popped out as a result? That chemical magic is known by the highfalutin name of dimensional analysis and it turns out it is useful in computer systems analysis too.
