### General
- tmpfs is a temporary file system in [[UNIX (OS)]]-like operating systems that stores data in [[Random Access Memory (RAM)|RAM (Computer Memory)]]  rather than on persistent storage. It's designed for fast access to temporary files, improving system performance, but data is lost upon reboot or unmount.
