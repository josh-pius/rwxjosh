### General
- `0xDEADBEEF` is a hexadecimal number that's used as a [[Magic Number (Software)]] in various software [[Operating System (OS)|Operating systems]]
- **Marking uninitialized memory**
	- 0xDEADBEEF was originally used to mark areas of [[Memory (Computer)|memory]] that had not yet been initialized. 
- **Indicating software crashes**
	- 0xDEADBEEF is often used to indicate a software crash or deadlock in embedded systems. 
- **Finding memory changes**
- 0xDEADBEEF can be used to fill the [[Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)|SRAM]] memory of a microcontroller with a recognizable pattern. This can help identify memory changes, such as: 
	- A [[Stack Overflow (Software)]]
	- Code writing beyond the end of an array
