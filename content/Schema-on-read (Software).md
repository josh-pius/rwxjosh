- Schema on read differs from schema on write becauseÂ **you create the schema only when reading the data**.
- The data itself can be structured, partially structured or unstructured 
- You can define a schema for the data and when the data is read the schema is applied
- This means you can run queries on data where there is no explicit table structure defined in the data itself
- If you use the data for different purposes you can have different schemas for different use cases
