### Leaf Mould
- [[J.R.R Tolkien (Author)]] when describing his own writing says
> it grows like a seed in the dark out of the leaf-mould of the mind: out of all that has been seen or thought or read, that has long been forgotten, descending into the deeps.
- Suggesting that having read and forgotten a work doesn't mean you've wasted your time, there are things you've taken away from it deeply embedded in you that continue to nourish your mind, thought and writing
