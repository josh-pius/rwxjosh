### Intuition
- If you take a line passing through the origin, it is a [[Vector Space (Linear Algebra)]]
- If you then shift it so that it does not pass through the origin, it is an affine line (shifted) and won't have zero in it's space which means it is no longer a [[Vector Space (Linear Algebra)]], however it is a [[Affine Space (Mathematics)]]
