### General
- A cone - sometimes called a linear cone to distinguish it from other sorts of cones is a subset of real vector space that is [[Closure Property (Mathematics)|closed]] under positive scalar multiplication
	- This is one of the definitions I saw, but I'm unsure if the term Cone only applies to [[Real Vector Space (Linear Algebra)]]
- Note: A cone is **NOT** a vector space
	- In a vector space if $v$ is a vector in the space then $\alpha v$ is also part of the space for positive and negative $\alpha$
	-  But for cones only vectors where $\alpha$ is positive is present
