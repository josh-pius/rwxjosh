### General
- In software, the term “transparent” refers to functionality or processes that occur in a way that is hidden from the user or developer, requiring little to no manual intervention, and without them needing to understand or manage the underlying details. 
- Transparency in software design aims to make systems easier to use, more reliable, or seamlessly integrated.
