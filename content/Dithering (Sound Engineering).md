### General
- Dithering is a process used during bit depth reduction (e.g., from 24-bit to 16-bit audio) to minimize distortion and preserve sound quality by adding a very small amount of random noise.
- When you reduce bit depth (say, when exporting to CD-quality 16-bit audio from a 24-bit mix), you:
	- Lose precision in quiet sounds
	- Risk introducing quantization distortion (harsh, unwanted digital artifacts)
- Dithering fixes this by:
	- Adding low-level noise that masks the distortion
	- Resulting in smoother, more natural-sounding audio
