- If $X_1,...,X_n$ are [[Independent (Probability)]] and each has the same [[Marginal Probability Distribution (Probability)]] with [[Cumulative Distribution Function (Probability)|CDF (Probability)]] F, we say that $X_1,...,X_n$ are [[Independently and Identically Distributed (IID) (Probability)]]
- And call $X_1,...,X_n$ a [[Random Sample (Probability)]] of size $n$ from F
