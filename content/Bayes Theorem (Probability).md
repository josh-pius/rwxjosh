### General
- [[Bayes Theorem (Probability)]]  describing how the conditional probability of each of a set of possible causes for a given observed outcome can be computed from knowledge of the probability of each cause and the conditional probability of the outcome of each cause.
- Aka Baye's Rule or Bayes's law
- The basis for [[Bayesian Network (Probabilistic Graph Model)]]

### Mathematical Form
$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\bar{A})P(\bar{A})}$
