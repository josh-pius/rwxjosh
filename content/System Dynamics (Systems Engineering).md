### General
- System dynamics (SD) is an approach to understanding the nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, table functions and time delays
- System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the 1950s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes, SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design.
- Originated in [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] and formalized by [[Jay W. Forrester (Computer Engineer)]] in his book [[Industrial Dynamics (Book)]]
	- He is credited as the founder of [[System Dynamics (Systems Engineering)]]
- In this [video](https://youtu.be/o-Yp8A7BPE8?si=VSSDeem50OmXNMCI) the lecturer argues that [[System Dynamics (Systems Engineering)]] is applied [[Systems Thinking (Field of Study)]]

### Modeling

- All models are wrong- some models are useful

### System Thinking Tools

1. Causal Links
2. Loops: Balancing and Reinforcing
3. [[Stock and Flow (System Engineering)]]

### Example of Use of System Dynamics
- [[Jay W. Forrester (Computer Engineer)]] tried to apply his background in engineering to business systems. 
- He was brought in as a consultant to find out why a [[General Electric (Company)|GE]] appliance plant had a a lot of people quit every three year cycle. He sat down and handcoded one of the first system dynamics models in this field and presented it

### My Thoughts
- I don't really understand if this field is bs or if it's actually beneficial
- One of the contributions of [[Systems Engineering (Field of Study)]] is [[Unified Modeling Language (UML)]] which has been dead for a while now and at least some think it was failure altogether
- I wonder if even the the systems dynamics thing is something that product managers try to push on projects even though it might not bring value
- After watching [this](https://youtu.be/MSo8kqbLDlw?si=ZmuxOGOfSchaaQoY) I feel there maybe some merit to this field
