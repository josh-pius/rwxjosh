- PDCAAS, or Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score, is a method for evaluating human protein quality by assessing a protein's amino acid profile and its true fecal digestibility. Recommended by the FAO/WHO in 1989, the PDCAAS method uses a reference amino acid pattern for preschool-age children, correcting for the protein's digestibility to determine its value for human nutrition. While widely used, the method has been criticized for limitations, such as truncating scores over 100% and not fully accounting for anti-nutritional factors, leading to the development of new protein evaluation methods like DIAAS
