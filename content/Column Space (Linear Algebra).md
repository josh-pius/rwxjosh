### General
- The column space (or column span) of a matrix is the [[Span (Linear Algebra)]] (set of all possible [[Linear Combination (Linear Algebra)]]) of its column vectors.
- The column space is also called the range
- The column space is a [[Subspace (Linear Algebra)]] of $\mathbb{R}^m$ for a matrix $m \times n$
- For a matrix A, the column space is represented as $C(A)$
- It is an example of a  [[Vector Space (Linear Algebra)]]
- For a matrix $A$ with columns   $a_1$, $a_2$,$....$, $a_n$ ​ , the column space of $A$ is the set of all vectors that can be written in the form  $c_1a_1$+ $c_2a_2$+ $c_3a_3$+ $....$ +$c_na_n$ ​ where    $c_1 ​ ,c_2 ​ ,…,c_n$ ​ are scalars.
- This essentially means that the column space consists of all vectors that can be reached by linearly combining the columns of  A.
- By the definition of a vector space the origin is necessary a part of the column space
- For a system of linear equations $AX=b$, the system can be solved when $b$ is in the column space of A i.e. $C(A)$



### Significance
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_spaces#Column_space
- This is a really useful insight
- For a matrix $A$, the column space is the [[Image (Mathematics)]] ([[range (Function) (Mathematics)]]) of the matrix transformation $Ax$
- x could be any vector you can think of, it will be covered by the [[Column Space (Linear Algebra)]]
