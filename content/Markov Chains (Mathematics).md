### General
- Great video by [[Khan Academy Labs (Youtuber)]] that help you understand the history and motivation behind [[Markov Chains (Mathematics)]]
	- Talk about the drama between Pavel Nekrasov and Markov

- Excellent video from [[Topics In Mathematics With Applications in Finance (MIT Course)]]: https://youtu.be/TuTmC8aOQJE?si=ZxzuMtQzbhuy4oe_


### Difference B/w Markov Chain and Finite State Machine

- [[Finite-State Machine (Computer Science)]]
- A Markov chain is a model that we can use to describe stochastic time-dependent processes.
- A stochastic process is a process where the transition from the current state to the next is determined not only by the current state of the system, but also by an element of surprise or randomness that require a probabilistic description as opposed to a deterministic one.


### Article On Markov Chains

- Tried reading this math heavy article on Markov chains
- While I was able to understand some of it, I don't think I really grokked the concept still
