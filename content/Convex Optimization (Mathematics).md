### General
- Specific case of [[Optimization Theory (Mathematics)]]
- Convex optimization focuses on a particular class of optimization problems where both the objective function and the constraint set are convex. 
- Convexity refers to the property that any line segment connecting two points within the set lies entirely within the set. This property makes convex optimization problems particularly tractable because convexity guarantees that any local minimum is also a global minimum.
- Convex optimization has wide-ranging applications in various fields, including portfolio optimization, machine learning, signal processing, control systems, and operations research. It offers efficient algorithms and mathematical tools for solving optimization problems in a reliable and computationally efficient manner.
