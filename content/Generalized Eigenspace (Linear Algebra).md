### General
- The set of all [[Generalized Eigenvectors (Linear Algebra)]] associated to an eigenvalue is called a generalized eigenspace.
- **Definition** Let A be a $K	\times K$ matrix. Let $\lambda$ be an [[Eigenvalue (Linear Algebra)]] of A. The set of all [[Generalized Eigenvectors (Linear Algebra)]] (plus the zero vector)
	- $\mathcal{N}((A-\lambda I)^K)$ - (N() is the null space operator I think) is called the generalized eigenspace associated to $\lambda$.
