### General
- A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique string of numbers, letters, and symbols that identifies an article or book and links to it on the web. DOIs are created by publishers to identify content on digital networks. They are often displayed prominently in the bibliographic information for a publication, near the copyright notice on the first page or first several pages of the document
