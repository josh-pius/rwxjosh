### General
- A superblock is a critical data structure in a filesystem that contains essential metadata about the filesystem itself. 
- It acts as the control center for the filesystem, telling the operating system how to interpret and manage the data stored on disk.


### Excerpt From OSTEP

- The superblock contains information about a particular file system, including, for example, how many inodes and data blocks are in the file system (80 and 56, respectively in this instance), where the inode table begins (block 3), and so forth. 
- It will likely also include a magic number of some kind to identify the file system type (in this case, vsfs)
