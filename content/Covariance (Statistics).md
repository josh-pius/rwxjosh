### General
- Let X and Y be [[Random Variable (Probability)]] with means $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ and [[Standard Deviation (Statistics)]] $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_Y$. Define the covariance between X and Y by
	- $\text{Cov}(X,Y)=E((X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y))$
- And [[Correlation (Statistics)]] by 
	- $\rho=\rho_{X,Y}=\rho(X,Y)=\dfrac{\text{Cov(X,Y)}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$
- The covariance satisfies $\text{Cov}(X,Y)=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)$
- Correlation satisfies $-1\leq \rho(X,Y) \leq 1$
- If X and Y are [[Independent (Probability)]] then $Cov(X,Y)=\rho=0$. The converse is not true in general
