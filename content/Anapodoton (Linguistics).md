### General
- A popular rhetorical device, anapodoton is when the main clause of a phrase that is unsaid, is implied by a well-known subordinate clause
- When someone says, ‘When in Rome…’ and leaves the sentence midway, we know that the sentence would go on to have a main clause i.e, ‘Do as Romans do’. This literary technique where a main clause of a sentence is suggested by the introduction of a subordinate clause is known as anapodoton
- Overtime people even forget what the main clause is
