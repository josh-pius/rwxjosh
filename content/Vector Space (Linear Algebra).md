### General
- An important concept in [[Linear Algebra (Mathematics)]]. A vector space $V$ over field $F$ (commonly real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ or complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$). Is a set V of elements called vectors, together with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication, that satisfy eight axioms designed to ensure linear structure.
- Among these 8, most are obvious the the ones in bold are what you need to pay attention to 
1. Additive Closure 
2. Additive Associativity
3. Additive Identity
4. Additive Inverse
5. Scalar Multiplication Closure
6. Distributivity over Scalar Multiplication with respect to Vector Addition
7. Distributivity over scalar multiplication with respect to Field Addition
8. Associativity of Scalar Multiplication
9. Multiplicative Identity

### Example
- All $\mathbb{R^n}$ are complete vector spaces, (n-1) vectors in $\mathbb{R^n}$ space would also be a vector space analogous to a plane in the $\mathbb{R^n}$ space
- It's a valid vector space because any linear combination of the (n-1) vectors would fall within that speace (note: This is assuming those n-1 vectors are orthogonal (?))


### Union and Intersection
- Say we have two vector spaces S and T
- $S \cup T$ need NOT necessarily be a vector space
- $S \cap T$ is a vector space
