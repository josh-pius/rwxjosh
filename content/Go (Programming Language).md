### Cross-Platform Compilation
- Source: [[Rwxrob (Youtuber)]]
- Something cool about Go is that you can compile a [[Go (Programming Language)]] for any [[Operating System (OS)]] and chipset (x86 or amd? arm?)
- You can be on a linux machine and run this 
	- `GOOS=windows go build <file>`
	- It would create a windows [[Portable Executable (PE)]] `.exe` file which wouldn't work on linux but would work just fine if you copied it over to windows machine

- [[ThePrimegen (YouTuber)]] loves [[Go (Programming Language)|Golang (Programming Language)]] because there are no [[Colored Functions (Software)]]
	- You only have to deal with channels (?)
