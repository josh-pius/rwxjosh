### General
- [[Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)]] cores are the fundamental processing units within NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) designed to execute computations in parallel. 
- CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is [[NVIDIA (Company)]]'s parallel computing platform and programming model, allowing developers to use the [[Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)|GPU]] for general-purpose computing tasks (often called GPGPU).
