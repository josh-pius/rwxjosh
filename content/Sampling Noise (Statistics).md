  - Sampling Error (Statistics)

### General
- Even if a sample is [[Sampling Bias (Statistics)|Unbiased (Sampling)]] the results you get while extrapolating to the population might have an error
	- Example: A 100 flips of a fair coin might give you 45H-55T, this is an error due to sampling but  fixes itself with more fair trials
- This error decreases with sample size. In that way this seems related to [[Standard Error (SE) (Statistics)]]
