### General
- An overdetermined system in mathematics is a system of equations where there are more equations than there are unknowns. 
	- The reverse situations is [[Underdetermined (Mathematics)]]
- These systems are often inconsistent, meaning they have no exact solution that satisfies all equations simultaneously. 
- However, they can be solved using the method of [[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)|least square]] to find an approximate solution that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the left and right sides of the equations
