### General
- Heard about it first from [[Rwxrob (Youtuber)]]



### Example
- [[BusyBox (Software)]] is an popular example
	- If you check the `/bin` library, `ls -l /bin` on [[Alpine (Linux Distro)]] you'll see that all the commands are [[Symlink (Linux)|symlinks]] to [[BusyBox (Software)]], which is pretty cool
	- Every single command in busybox is one command/one binary. And this binary is small enough to fit on a floppy disk
